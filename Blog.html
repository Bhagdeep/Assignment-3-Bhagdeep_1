        Challenges:
          I had issues with the search function at first, however i was able to get help from a
          fellow student who somewhat pointed me in the right direction. I also had some issues with
          understanding the modal. With no visual refference for some reason i was stumped on how i should
          code it. Even though the design of it was all in the style.css i couldnt get it to work at first.
          However after looking throught the online notes, lectures, and a bit of help from a fellow classmate
          i was able to make it work. The only thing i couldnt get to work properly was the New Twits Author name following
          the code of the Style.css and being bold faced and to the lower right of the block. Its just the same style as the
          twit text.

            but it i thought i was going no where i would google for some answers. I saw some example codes
            that seemed to point me in the right direction.
